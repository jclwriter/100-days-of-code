I see to get lost in time when I am coding, or writing for that matter. I have been known to code into the wee hours of the morning, especially as of late, with this project that I feel very strongly for.

I was told, time and time again to find something you want to do and learn to code by creating that project. Let me tell you, it is far more fun doing it that way than just coding a long with boring lessons.

Anyways, for Day 7 I continued with my shop script, as well as adding more functionality for the rest of the game. However, like I tweeted earlier, as I was coding, I throught of a different way to code everything, mainly the commands section. Right now I am basically using a lot of is and elif, with all the commands under one function. Instead, I am going to make each command its only function. This will clean up the code, making it not only easier to read, but easier to modify in the future. I will change the code on my R1D8.
