### Day 7: Febuary 18th, 2018 ###

I see to get lost in time when I am coding, or writing for that matter. I have been known to code into the wee hours of the morning, especially as of late, with this project that I feel very strongly for.

I was told, time and time again to find something you want to do and learn to code by creating that project. Let me tell you, it is far more fun doing it that way than just coding a long with boring lessons.

Anyways, for Day 7 I continued with my shop script, as well as adding more functionality for the rest of the game. However, like I tweeted earlier, as I was coding, I throught of a different way to code everything, mainly the commands section. Right now I am basically using a lot of is and elif, with all the commands under one function. Instead, I am going to make each command its only function. This will clean up the code, making it not only easier to read, but easier to modify in the future. I will change the code on my R1D8.

### Day 8, Febuary 19th, 2018 ###

Today was a bit of a hit and miss in getting started, but once I was in, I didn't want to come out.
I didn't really messed with the shop script, the skeleton is there, but I had some thoughts, and I will be going a different route, most likely.

Watched a few coding videos, read up a bit on some Python OOP concepts, then went to town on testing it out.

Created a Monster class, then went about creating a script that allowed me to create as many monsters as I wanted on the fly. 

Then I went a step further and modified the script to create a random number of monsters.

THEN, I went even further and made it so that it created a random number of monsters from a list of different types of monsters.

And, yes, you guessed it, I took it another step. I gave the monster an attack feature, and had it so that each of them attacked just once in a round of combat. Worked like a charm. I don't think you would want to be in a room when there are 100 Goblins attacking you. ;)

While coding all of this, I thought up a cool mini-game.

Want to know what it is? I bet you do, but that will be for another day. :)
